# CREDIT RISK CLASSIFICATION

## PURPOSE
Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. This program uses various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
